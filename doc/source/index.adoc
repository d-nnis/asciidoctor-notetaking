// excerpt-begin

Markup languages like `Asciidoc` are perfectly suited for fast note taking.
Type your notes with your favourite editor, view and browse them with
`Chromium`, `Chrome` or `Firefox`.

// excerpt-end

All you need is the `adoc-note` script and Chromium, Chrome or Firefox with the
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/asciidoctorjs-live-previe/iaalpfgpbocpdfblpnhhgllgbdbchmia[Chrome
Asciidoctor.js Live Preview] extension or the
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/asciidoctorjs-live-preview/[Firefox
Asciidoctor.js Live Preview] extension.

`adoc-note` runs under Linux and Windows.footnote:[For Mac follow Linux
instructions (not tested).] The  script operates in four modes depending on
it's options (see <<_invoking_the_script>>):

Create a new note::
	Creates a new context depending asciidoc note file.

Edit notes::
	Launches an editor.

View notes:: Launches a live-previewer (Firefox, Chrome of Chromium).

Sync filename:: Renames the filename to be in sync with the document's title.

.Quickstart

. Read the installation guide for <<_linux>> or <<_windows>>.
. Read about the 2 most common use cases <<_how_students_take_notes>>.

<<<

== How students take notes

A fellow student still uses paper and pen. I ask her why and she replied
"`I can better concentrate. My computer distracts me. I will do all other
things, but not listening.`".

This is certainly true. As I am concerned I am not good at logistics. For me
having all documents and notes in one little machine is a blessing.

To illustrate how to work with `adoc-note` here my most common
workflows.

=== The lesson starts

.The folder in which the new note will be created.
image::workflow1-1.png[scaledwidth=60%]

Alternatively you can open the folder you want to create a new note in
and right-click on some empty white space.

.The new file
image::workflow1-2.png[scaledwidth=40%]

.Editor and Browser windows with unmodified template
image::workflow1-3.png[scaledwidth=100%]

.Title change
image::workflow1-4.png[scaledwidth=100%]

.Some text added
image::workflow1-5.png[scaledwidth=100%]

.The new note file on disk after closing the editor
image::workflow1-6.png[scaledwidth=60%]

NOTE: Before and after launching the editor `adoc-note` renames the file
to be in sync with the asciidoc title. For more details see
<<_asciidoc_title_filename_sync>>.

=== Taking notes about a file

<<<

== Create a new note

There are several ways to launch `adoc-note`.

Linux::
* Launch the commands in shell as described the sections _Syntax_ below.

* Right click on a file or directory in your file-manger and choose _adoc-note_
  in the context menu. See <<_integration_with_file_manager>>.

Windows::
* Drag and drop a file or directory on the shortcut `adoc-note.bat` on your
desktop.
+
This method also works in very restricted environments. The only rights you need
is to be allowed to execute portable binaries and batch scripts.
You also need the permission to install the _Asciidoctor.js Live Preview_ plugin
in Chromium, Chrome or Firefox.

* Double-click the shortcut `adoc-note.bat` on your desktop. This will place
a new note on your desktop.

* Right click on a file or directory in file explorer and choose _adoc-note_
  in the context menu. See <<_integration_with_file_manager>>.

=== Invoking the script

[source, bash]
 adoc-note -h

shows a short help text with available command line options:

....
/usr/local/bin/adoc-note creates, edits or views an asciidoc note.

usage:

   /usr/local/bin/adoc-note [-h][-ro|-so|-eo] | [<File.adoc>|<Dir>|<File>]

<Dir>|<File>: directory where the new note file will be created
(current directory if none).
If <File> is given a new adoc note will be created next to that file.
If <File.adoc> is given the file is edited.
Filename of <File> is changed when not in sync with title.

Options:
-ro     Do not open editor, open viewer only.
-eo     Do not open viewer, only new note or, sync filename and edit.
-so     Do not open editor or viewer, only new note or sync filename.
....

.`adoc-note` options
|===
|Option | Create a new note | Launch editor | Launch viewer |  Sync title-filename 

|_without_ | {y} {c} | {y} | {y} | {y}
|`-ro`     | {y} {c} | {n} | {y} | {n}
|`-eo`     | {y} {c} | {y} | {n} | {y}
|`-so`     | {y} {c} | {n} | {n} | {y}
|===

.Lengend
{y} =  yes +
{n} =  no +
{c} =  If a note with the same filename exists on disk already, no new note is 
created.


=== Directory as parameter

==== Syntax

[source, bash]
 adoc-note <path>/<dir>


creates the following document:


 <path>/<dir>/YYYYMMDD-<dir>--Notes.adoc

.<path>/<dir>/YYYYMMDD-<dir>--Notes.adoc
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
= <dir> : Notes
<loginname>
v1.0, <date>
:numbered:
:toc!:
:pagenums:

----
====


==== Example

[source, bash]
 adoc-note 'doc/Lecture 1'


creates the following document:

  doc/Lecture 1/20151129-Lecture 1--Notes.adoc

.doc/Lecture 1/20151129-Lecture 1-- Notes.adoc
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
= Lecture 1 : Notes
johndoe
v1.0, 29.11.2015
:numbered:
:toc!:
:pagenums:

----
====



=== No parameter

==== Syntax

It is also possible to invoke the script without options:

[source,bash]
 adoc-note

The result is the same as above but the current working directory is used for
`<path>/<dir>`.

==== Example

[source, bash]
 cd 'doc/Lecture 1'
 adoc-note

creates the following document:

 doc/Lecture 1/20151129-Lecture 1--Notes.adoc

.doc/Lecture 1/20151129-Lecture 1--Notes.adoc
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
= Lecture 1 : Notes
johndoe
v1.0, 29.11.2015
:numbered:
:toc!:
:pagenums:

== Notes
----
====



=== Filename as parameter

The filename should be some existing local file you want to annotate.
For example I use this feature to note from where I have downloaded a .pdf.

==== Syntax

When invoke with a filename, no date stamp is prepended.

[source,bash]
 adoc-note <path>/<dir>/<filename>

The new file will look like this:

 <path>/<dir>/<filename>--Notes.adoc



.<path>/<dir>/<filename>-- Notes.adoc
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
= <filename> : Notes
<loginname>
v1.0, <date>
:numbered:
:toc!:
:pagenums:

Annotations on file: link:++<filename>++[]
----
====

==== Example

[source, bash]
 adoc-note 'doc/Implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.pdf'


creates the following document:

  doc/Implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.pdf--Notes.adoc

.doc/Implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.pdf--Notes.adoc
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
= Implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.pdf : Notes
johndoe
v1.0, 29.11.2015
:numbered!:
:toc!:
:pagenums:


Annotations on file: link:++Implementing-the-NIST-Cybersecurity-Framework.pdf++[]
----
====

Before quitting the `adoc-note` script executes it's _editing-mode_. This opens
in your editor the completed template (see example above) and a live-previewr
showing the rendered asciidoc file:

.Rendered note
====
image::example-filename.png[scaledwidth=70%]

<<<
== Editing notes

=== Syntax

[source,bash]
  adoc-note <path>/<filename>.adoc

launches the the `gvim` editor by default. Replace `gvim` by any editor of your
choice. At the same time a `chrome` or `chromium` window will pop up
showing the live rendition of your asciidoc file. You need to have the
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/asciidoctorjs-live-previe/iaalpfgpbocpdfblpnhhgllgbdbchmia[Asciidoctor.js
Live Preview] extension installed.

You may want to use some autosave editor feature in order to observe changes
immediately in the rendered preview live.

At the beginning and the end of the `adoc-note` script another helper function
`ChangeFilename` is called. It guarantees that any change in the asciidoc title
of the file you have been editing will replicate in the filename of that
asciidoc file. This guarantees that *the filenames of asciidoc notes always
correspond to their asciidoc title* allowing you to find your notes quickly in
your directory structure. See <<_asciidoc_title_filename_sync>> for more
details.

NOTE: You can disable the title-filename-sync feature by adding a blank line at
the beginning of the asciidoc document.

=== Example

[source,bash]
  adoc-note 'Implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.pdf--Notes.adoc'

.adoc-edit invokation example
image::adoc-edit.png[]

The same result is obtained by repeating the same command you used to create
this note footnote:[This only works if you have not changed the original
title in the meantime!]:

[source,bash]
  adoc-note 'Implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.pdf'

<<<





== Viewing notes

=== Syntax

[source,bash]
  adoc-note -ro <path>/<filename>.adoc

launches `firefox` or `chromium`.  You need to have the
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/asciidoctorjs-live-preview/[Firefox Asciidoctor.js
Live Preview] extension or the
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/asciidoctorjs-live-previe/iaalpfgpbocpdfblpnhhgllgbdbchmia[Chrome
Asciidoctor.js Live Preview] extension installed.


=== Example

[source,bash]
  adoc-note -ro 'Implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.pdf--Notes.adoc'

.adoc-view invokation example
image::adoc-view.png[scaledwidth=70%]

All text in the above example was automatically generated by the `adoc-note`
script only the last link _download URL_ was added "`by hand`". This is
particularly useful for quickly writing down the source of a downloaded
document.

== Asciidoc title-filename sync

Consider the following note file:

  20151208-Make this world a better place--Suggestions.adoc

The filename has 3 parts:

   <order mark>-<simplified-title>--<simplified-subtitle>.adoc

A `<order mark>` can be a

* _chronological order mark_ or
+
.Chronological order marks
====
	20140211-
	20151208-
====


* _a sequence number order mark_.
+
.Sequence number order marks
====
	02-
	08-
	09_02-
====

`<order mark>` can be any combination of `0123456789-_`.

When `adoc-note` creates a new note based on a directory it prepends a
_chronological order mark_ of today. The `<simplified-title>` part is derived
from the parent directory name omitting its own _order mark_.

.New note in a directory with sequence number order mark
====
image::filing-system1.png[scaledwidth=70%]

[source,bash]
  adoc-note '10-Mein Körper'

will result in a new file:


image::filing-system2.png[scaledwidth=40%]

  10-Mein Körper/20151209-Mein Körper--Notes.adoc

NOTE: The parent directory's order mark is never used to compose a filename for
a new note.
====

When `adoc-note` creates a new note based on a filename no
_order mark_ is prepended.

Before and after editing the `adoc-note` analyses the title and subtitle
of the asciidoc file and simplifies them in a filesystem friendly form.
If the result does not equal to `<simplified-title>--<simplified-subtitle>`
the filename is changed on disk. Possible _order marks_ remain untouched.


NOTE: You can disable this feature by inserting a blank line at the beginning
of the asciidoc file.

IMPORTANT: `adoc-note` might change the note's filename but never changes an
_order mark_!


For details about how an Asciidoc title line is simplified into
a `<simplified-title>--<simplified-subtitle>` string refer to the
`SanitizeFilename()` function in <<_src_adoc_note>>.




<<<
== Installation and configuration

`adoc-note` runs on Linux and Windows. For Windows installation and 
configuration see <<_windows>> below.

=== Linux

. Install `chromium`  (alternatively you can use `chrome` or
`firefox`).footnote:[At the time of this writing only `chromium` and `chrome`
refresh automatically and can be launched in application interface mode. My
preferred choice.]

. Install the
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/asciidoctorjs-live-previe/iaalpfgpbocpdfblpnhhgllgbdbchmia[Chrome
Asciidoctor.js Live Preview ]
extension.  (Or
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/asciidoctorjs-live-preview/[Firefox
Asciidoctor.js Live Preview] )

. Download the note-taking-script `bin/adoc-note` from Github
https://github.com/getreu/asciidoctor-notetaking[getreu/asciidoctor-notetaking].
  Alternatively you can copy and paste the listing at end of this document.

. Copy it in a location of your `$PATH` and make it executable for everyone.
+
[source,bash]
  sudo cp adoc-note /usr/local/bin
  sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/adoc-note

. Install some helper packages (most should be already on your system)
footnote:[`uni2ascii` is only needed for `chrome` and `chromium`].
+
[source,bash]
  sudo apt-get install dirname basename sed uni2ascii vim-gtk
+
Replace `vim-gtk` with an editor of your choice. Configure `adoc-note`
accordingly.

. Configuration: +
At the beginning of `adoc-note` you will find a section enclosed in the
commments `CONFIGURATION SECTION START` and `CONFIGURATION SECTION END`.
+
NOTE: The only file you edit to change the default choices for _editor_ and
_viewer_ under Linux is `adco-note`. *Not* `adoc-note.bak`!
+
Here you can specify what editor you want to use, if you choose `firefox`,
`chrome` or `chromium` and you can specify the parameters these programs
require.  Make sure that your editor does not fork when launched. If it does
fork, the script will still work but when you quit, no asciidoc-title-filename
sync will occur.  Outside the `CONFIGURATION SECTION` no changes should be
necessary.
+
WARNING: The environment variables `ADOC_EDITOR` or `ADOC_VIEWER` -when defined-
have precedence over settings in the `CONFIGURATION SECTION` and will override
them.

. Test the installation: open a console window and type
`adoc-note`.  An _editor_ and _viewer_ window containing a note template should
open.

. Optional: integrate the scripts with your file-manager (see
<<_linux_file_manager_configuration>>).

=== Windows

. Install `chromium`  (alternatively you can use `chrome` or
`firefox`).footnote:[At the time of this writing only `chromium` and `chrome`
refresh automatically and can be launched in application interface mode. My
preferred choice.]

. Install the
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/asciidoctorjs-live-previe/iaalpfgpbocpdfblpnhhgllgbdbchmia[Chrome
Asciidoctor.js Live Preview ]
extension.  (Or
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/asciidoctorjs-live-preview/[Firefox
Asciidoctor.js Live Preview] )

. Download the the files `bin/adoc-note`, `bin/adoc-note.bat` and
`bin/busybox.exe` from Github
https://github.com/getreu/asciidoctor-notetaking[getreu/asciidoctor-notetaking].
  Alternatively you can copy and paste the listings at end of this document.
  The version of `busybox` in the above repository is probably outdated.
  Please get a newer version from here: http://frippery.org/busybox/

. Copy the 3 files in a directory of your choice. In the following I call
this directory _BIN_DIR_.

. Configuration:
+
At the beginning of `adoc-note.bak` you will find a section enclosed in the
commments `CONFIGURATION SECTION START` and `CONFIGURATION SECTION END`.
+
NOTE: The only file you edit to change the default choices for _editor_ and
_viewer_ under Windows is `adco-note.bat`. *Not* `adoc-note`!
+
IMPORTANT: New notes are created with an Unicode BOM indicating Unicode encoding.
Do not use the `notepad` editor as it does not understand Unicode. Use
`Wordpad` or and other modern Unicode editor instead.
+
Here you can specify what browser you want to use, e.g. if you choose
`firefox.exe` or `chromium.exe` and you can specify the parameters these
programs require.  Do the same for the editor of your choice. Make sure that
your editor does not fork when launched. If it does fork, the script will still
work but when you quit, no asciidoc-title-filename sync will occur.  Outside the
`CONFIGURATION SECTION` no changes should be necessary.

. Create a shortcut to `adoc-note.bat` on your desktop, click on properties
and change the shortcut to _run minimized_. Let the _start in_ path empty.
+
image::shortcut-properties.png[]


. Test the installation: drag a file or directory on the `adoc-note Shortcut`
on your desktop. An _editor_ and _viewer_ window should open.

. Optional: integrate the scripts with your file-manager (see
<<_windows_file_explorer_configuration>>).
